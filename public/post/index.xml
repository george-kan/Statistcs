      <description>Let’s talk (briefly) about samplesHow exactly should you conceptualise the idea of a sample of size 50 from a distribution?
For this I am going to use the typical (fair) coin tossing example.
The easiest way to answer the question “What do we mean by a sample of size 50?” is “Well flip the coin 50 times and see what comes up!”</description>

      <description>Why do we need an estimator?In the previous post we discussed statistical models and the idea that a statistical model is a pair \({\left(S, \{ P_\theta \} _{\theta \in \Theta }\right)}\). We also discussed the fact that if our model is well specified then the true distribution (the one that governs reality) will be included in our selected family of distributions \(P_{\theta \in \Theta}\) for certain \(\theta\). But we did not discuss at all how we can estimate this \(\theta\).</description>

      <description>Statistical models, what are they?Statistical models are a way of approximating reality using probability distributions.
Let’s say that we want to analyse the hourly number of customers coming to a shop from 9-5 in order to assess how many people are needed to work. To that extent, we measure the number of customers that we observed in a day and the results looked like this:
Time intervalCustomers9-10310-11211-12112-13313-14214-15115-16016-173Our goal is to be able to explain reality using probabilities.</description>
