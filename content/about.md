This blog serves two purposes for me:
1) I want to improve my understanding of statistics both by writing and by getting feedback. My understanding so far has mainly been influenced by [the MIT course on statistics](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.6501x+2T2020/course/) and therefore most topics will be based on this.   
2) I want to present various analyses and data science related topics
