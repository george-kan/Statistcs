<h2><em>Why do we need an estimator?</em></h2>
<p>In the previous <a href="/2020/08/25/first-post/">post</a> we discussed statistical models and the idea that a statistical model is a pair <span class="math inline">\({\left(S, \{ P_\theta \} _{\theta \in \Theta }\right)}\)</span>. We also discussed the fact that if our model is well specified then the true distribution (the one that governs reality) will be included in our selected family of distributions <span class="math inline">\(P_{\theta \in \Theta}\)</span> for certain <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. But we did not discuss at all how we can estimate this <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. This is where <em>estimators</em> come into play.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a true distribution with the true parameter <span class="math inline">\(\color{blue}\theta\)</span> and we can obtain sample data from that distribution. Our goal is to be able to estimate quantities of the true distribution such as <span class="math inline">\(\color{blue}\theta\)</span>, its mean, its median etc. by using the sample data. In particular, what we need is a function that takes as input the sample data from the true distribution and outputs a “guess” or an estimate for the quantity of the true distribution we are interested in.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose the true distribution is a Poisson with lambda = 2 (<strong>lambda is unknown to us</strong>) and we can obtain sample data as seen in the picture below.
<em>What would be a good guess for lambda given the sample data?</em></p>

<h3><em>Back to searching for lambda</em></h3>
<p>Coming back to our original question we were trying to find a good guess for lambda given the sample data.<br />
To answer this question we have to think a bit about our distribution. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> follows a Poisson distribution with parameter lambda, then we know that the mean of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> equals lambda (<span class="math inline">\(E[X] = \lambda\)</span>).<br />
In our example, as we discussed previously we view the samples as <span class="math inline">\(X_1, \ldots , X_{n} \stackrel{iid}{\sim } Pois(\lambda)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the true parameter of the distribution we are looking for. Therefore, we know that <span class="math inline">\(E[X_1] = E[X_2] = ... = E[X_n] = \lambda\)</span></p>
<p>That gives a hint as to what would be a good estimator for lambda, the sample mean.</p>
<p>What is also clear from the picture is that the value for our estimator (the sample mean) changes depending on the sample size and the sample itself. For different samples we will get different values for our estimator.<br />
Let’s call the estimator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\lambda}\)</span>. It is a function of the sample which in turn is a random variable
And looking at the chart above, we see that as the sample size goes bigger, the sample mean goes to 2 which is indeed the lambda of the true distribution.</p>
<p>But are we sure that it is a good estimator? What if it was by chance? Can we quantify how good an estimator is?</p>
