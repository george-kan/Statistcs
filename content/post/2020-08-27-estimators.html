<h2><em>Why do we need an estimator?</em></h2>
<p>In the previous <a href="/2020/08/25/first-post/">post</a> we discussed statistical models and the idea that a statistical model is a pair <span class="math inline">\({\left(S, \{ P_\theta \} _{\theta \in \Theta }\right)}\)</span>. We also discussed the fact that if our model is well specified then the true distribution (the one that governs reality) will be included in our selected family of distributions <span class="math inline">\(P_{\theta \in \Theta}\)</span> for certain <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. But we did not discuss at all how we can estimate this <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. This is were <em>estimators</em> come into play.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a true distribution with the true parameter <span class="math inline">\(\color{blue}\theta\)</span> and we can obtain data from that distribution. Our goal is to be able to “guess” what that parameter is by using the data.</p>
