<h2><em>Why do we need an estimator?</em></h2>
<p>In the previous <a href="/2020/08/25/first-post/">post</a> we discussed statistical models and the idea that a statistical model is a pair <span class="math inline">\({\left(S, \{ P_\theta \} _{\theta \in \Theta }\right)}\)</span>. We also discussed the fact that if our model is well specified then the true distribution (the one that governs reality) will be included in our selected family of distributions <span class="math inline">\(P_{\theta \in \Theta}\)</span> for certain <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. But we did not discuss at all how we can estimate this <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. This is were <em>estimators</em> come into play.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a true distribution with the true parameter <span class="math inline">\(\color{blue}\theta\)</span> and we can obtain sample data from that distribution. Our goal is to be able to estimate quantities of the true distribution such as <span class="math inline">\(\color{blue}\theta\)</span>, its mean or its median by using the sample data. In particular, what we need is a function that takes as input the sample data from the true distribution and outputs a “guess” or an estimate for the quantity of the true distribution we are interested in.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose the true distribution is a Poisson with lambda = 2 (<strong>lambda is unknown to us</strong>) and we can obtain sample data as seen in the picture below.<br />
<em>What would be a good guess for lambda given the sample data?</em></p>

To answer this question we have to think a bit about our distribution. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> follows a Poisson distribution with parameter lambda, then we know that the mean of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> equals lambda (<span class="math inline">\(E[X] = \lambda\)</span>). That gives a hint as to what would be a good estimator for lambda, the sample mean. And looking at the chart above, we see that as the sample size goes bigger, the sample mean tends goes to 2 which is indeed the lambda of the true distribution.</p>
<p>But are we sure that it is a good estimator? What if it was by chance? Can we quantify how good an estimator is?</p>
