## _Why do we need an estimator?_

In the previous [post](/2020/08/25/first-post/) we discussed statistical models and the idea that a statistical model is a pair ${\left(S, \{ P_\theta \} _{\theta \in \Theta }\right)}$. We also discussed the fact that if our model is well specified then the true distribution (the one that governs reality) will be included in our selected family of distributions $P_{\theta \in \Theta}$ for certain $\theta$. But we did not discuss at all how we can estimate this $\theta$. This is were *estimators* come into play.    

Suppose we have a true distribution with the true parameter $\color{blue}\theta$ and we can obtain data from that distribution. Our goal is to be able to "guess" what that parameter is by using the data.
