_Note: This blog serves two purposes for me.  
1) I want to improve my understanding of statistics both by writing and by getting feedback. My understanding so far has mainly been influenced by [the MIT course on statistics](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.6501x+2T2020/course/) and therefore most topics will be based on this.   
2) I want to learn how to present various analyses and data science related topics_

## _Statistical models, what are they?_

_All models are wrong_ 

Statistical models are a way of approximating the results of a statistical experiment.
Let's say that we observe the number of customers coming to a gas station every hour from 9-5. What we would see could be something like this:

|Time interval|Customers|
|:----:|:-----:|
|9-10|  3  |
|10-11|  2  |
|11-12|  1  |
|12-13|  3  |
|13-14|  2  |
|14-15|  1  |
|15-16|  0  |
|16-17|  3  |


$$\displaystyle \{ \mathbb {P_\theta }\} _{\theta \in \Theta }$$



```{r}
x = seq(1, 10 , 0.1)
plot(x, sqrt(x))
```

**Does this work?**

$$ y_i = mx_i + c$$
