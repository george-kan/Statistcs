<h3><em>Let’s talk (briefly) about samples</em></h3>
<p>How exactly should you conceptualise the idea of a sample of size 50 from a distribution?<br />
For this I am going to use the typical (fair) coin tossing example.<br />
<img src="/post/2020-08-27-estimators_files/coin.jpg" alt="coin" /></p>
<p>The easiest way to answer the question “What do we mean by a sample of size 50?” is “Well flip the coin 50 times and see what comes up!”</p>
<p>While this is an intuitive way of understanding a sample, it is unfortunately not very helpful for statistical calculations. What we would like to do is to be able to treat each of the 50 samples as a random variable in order to calculate expectations, variances, distributions etc.</p>
<p>That is why we treat a sample of size 50 as the realisation of 50 independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables with the same distribution.</p>
<p>Basically what we mean by this is that instead of viewing the sample as “Taking 1 coin and flipping it 50 times”, we can equivalently view it as “Taking 50 coins which have the same probability of landing heads and flipping all of them 1 time”</p>
<p>We write this as <span class="math inline">\(X_1, \ldots , X_{50} \stackrel{iid}{\sim } Ber(0.5)\)</span>, which means that the random variables <span class="math inline">\(X_1 - X_{50}\)</span> are independent and identically distributed and follow a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution">Bernoulli distribution</a> with parameter <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.5\)</span> (the probability of success or heads).</p>
<p>With this in mind let’s move on to two of the most important theorems of statistics.</p>

<div id="the-law-of-large-numbers-lln" class="section level3">
<h3><em>The Law of large numbers (LLN)</em></h3>
<p>The law of large numbers (LLN) states that if we take the average of multiple trials of a probabilistic experiment, this average will end up being very close to the expected value of the experiment as the number of trials increases.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this relates in practice to our coin tossing example.</p>
<p>As we mentioned before a coin toss can be represented using a Bernoulli distribution with certain parameter <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The chart to the left represents an unbiased coin (same probability of heads or tails) while the one to the right a biased coin (probability of heads is equal to 0.7).</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-08-31-law-of-large-numbers-and-the-central-limit-theorem_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" />
What is the expected value of our distributions?<br />
The expected value of a Bernoulli random variable is equal to the probability of heads. In the charts above the expected value of the unbiased coin is <span class="math inline">\(E[X] = 0.5\)</span> and for the biased coin <span class="math inline">\(E[Y] = 0.7\)</span>.</p>
<p>The law of large numbers is saying that if you toss a big number of coins and take the average of the results of those coin tosses (1 for heads and 0 for tails) then this number will go closer and closer to the expected value. Let’s see this in practice for the biased coin (<span class="math inline">\(E[Y] = 0.7\)</span>).</p>
